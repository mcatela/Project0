          <span class="normaltext">The cavaquinho is a small Portuguese string instrument in the European guitar family, with four wire or gut strings.
          More broadly, cavaquinho is the name of a four-stringed subdivision of the lute family of instruments.
          Due to its smal size, cavaquinho  traveled around the world in the portuguese discoveries giving origin to several forms, each one used in different regions and for different styles of music. Separate varieties are named for Portugal, Braga (Cavaquinho PortuguÃªs), Madeira (Braguinha), Brazil (cavaquinho), Cape-Verde (cavaquinhio), Indonesia (keroncong) and the famous ukulele from Hawai.</span>

What is written here intends, through a set of notes and references, to cast a glance on this singularity, traversing and commenting on the historical, geographical, social and aesthetic turns of the cavaquinho. An answer to the question that relates tradition to contemporaneity, confronting the old with the modern, speaking of dialogues and incomunicabilities, convergences and conflicts.
